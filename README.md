# Dhivas Sugumar PersonalSite-V2

## About

This is a typescript first Next.js site using Tailwind to display five important aspects of my story so far:

- About me
- Experience
- Projects
- Contact
- Interests and personality

## Getting Started

Use your preferred package manager to install all dependencies.
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Code Structure

1. App
   These are the main pages that the app displays.
2. Packages
   Each one of these packages contains teh code and text for these features.

## Reuse

I believe in sharing knowledge, and learning from each other. Feel free to reuse this as a starter template to get your own personal portfolio site! Lines, Components, Pages, or even all of it (as long as you change the text)! Happy coding hacker.
