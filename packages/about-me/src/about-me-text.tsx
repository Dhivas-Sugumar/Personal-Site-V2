        My passion and curiosity for computers sparked when I first laid eyes on
        a Dell PC around 2009 at my dad's business. I was determined to have one
        at home, and after some persistence, my brothers and I finally got our
        own. I couldn’t resist tearing it apart and putting it back together,
        and from that moment on, I was hooked—I wanted to understand the
        language that made these machines tick: computer science.
        <br />
        <br />
        This led me to major in Computer Science at Northeastern University.
        Since then, I’ve mostly worked at startups, and currently, I’m a
        Software Engineer at Flexcar, building across mobile, web, backend, and
        internal tools. I have a passion for taking an idea from concept to
        solution—bridging pain points with thoughtful design and clean code,
        whether it's UI or code architecture.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of work, I love tinkering with personal projects, like the very
        site you’re reading now. When I’m not immersed in colorful lines of
        code, you’ll find me out in nature—hiking, rock climbing, star gazing,
        or diving into a good book, usually philosophy or non-fiction. No matter
        what I’m up to, I’m always capturing moments through film or Polaroid,
        documenting life one shot at a time.
