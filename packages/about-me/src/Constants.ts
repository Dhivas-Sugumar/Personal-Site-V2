export const aboutMeBody = `My passion and curiosity for computers sparked when I first laid eyes on a Dell PC around 2009 at my dad's business. I was determined to have one at home, and after some persistence, my brothers and I finally got our own. I couldn’t resist tearing it apart and putting it back together, and from that moment on, I was hooked—I wanted to understand the language that made these machines tick: computer science.\n

  This led me to major in Computer Science at Northeastern University. Since then, I’ve mostly worked at startups, and currently, I’m a Software Engineer at Flexcar, building across mobile, web, backend, and internal tools. I have a passion for taking an idea from concept to solution—bridging pain points with thoughtful design and clean code, whether it's UI or architecture. Outside of work, I love tinkering with personal projects, like the very site you’re reading now.
  
  When I’m not immersed in colorful lines of code, you’ll find me out in nature—hiking, rock climbing, star gazing, or diving into a good book, usually philosophy or non-fiction. No matter what I’m up to, I’m always capturing moments through film or Polaroid, documenting life one shot at a time.`;
